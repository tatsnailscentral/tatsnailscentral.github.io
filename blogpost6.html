            <p>
                But no, modern men do not think so at all. Neat and well-groomed hands have long been a must have for a strong half of humanity. What is this beauty treatment for men and how does it differ from the classic women's manicure? Manicure for men is a hygienic
                hand care procedure for men, after which they become neat and well-groomed. It should not be neglected by those for whom the appearance of the hands is extremely important, as part of the entire image of a person. In addition, regular
                manicure procedures will help prevent various nail problems.
                <br>
                <br> Unlike women's manicure, men's manicure traditionally does not use colored varnishes or gel varnishes, but special care products are used. Such a manicure consists in the processing and removal of the cuticle, shaping the nails, polishing
                them and in the care procedures.
                <br>
                <br> Although there are exceptions to the rules - more and more often today you can find drawings on men's nails. Men's manicure in 2021 is already less discreet than it was before. Coverage and design is an increasingly popular manicure
                innovation for men. The design of a man's manicure looks masculine and has nothing to do with glamor. So, drawings "under a tattoo", black drawings, black and white graphics and minimalism are relevant. Don't be afraid to experiment, because
                trends in men's manicure have changed a lot! Go For It!
