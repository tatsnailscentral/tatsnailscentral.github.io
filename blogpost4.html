                Many parents are concerned about this issue. After all, almost every little girl, watching her mother's beautiful and well-groomed hands, asks her to do the same. At what age can you begin to professionally care for children's hands, do a manicure, apply
                polish or gel polish? The baby's hands are taken care of from the very birth. During this period, it is more hygienic: the mother cuts the baby's nails and cleans them. The formation of the nail plate occurs until 14-16 years of age in
                humans, this type of care should be carried out as long as possible.
                <br>
                <br> However, even at preschool age, many girls ask to paint their nails, and at an older age even to build up or cover them with gel polish. At what age can you start doing this? Experts recommend using only regular nail polishes until
                the age of 12 since they do not require special treatment of the nail plate prior to application. As for building and covering with “adult” gel polish, it is recommended to do it after the age of 16-17. The same goes for edged manicures.
                Early use of gel polishes may lead to coarse cuticles, dryness, and will not prevent from the biting habit in children.
