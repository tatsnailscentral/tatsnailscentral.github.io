      <p>

        The nail plate consists of dead epithelial cells, or, simply put, the skin, which turn into horny nail plates.
        Since these are keratinized cells, they do not need to “breathe”. Accordingly, no matter how often you apply the
        coating to the nail plate, this will not affect its structure in any way. Therefore, a break from gel polish is
        not needed for nails.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another thing is how the gel coating is removed. Violation of technology can really adversely affect the
        condition of the nails. They can become thin and brittle and will require recovery. If your nail tech does
        everything correctly, then the gel polish coating will not ruin the nails, but, on the contrary, will protect
        them from external influences. There is also the opinion that the the nail plate is completely filed down before
        gel polish application which makes the plate very thin. Only the surface of old material is supposed to be filed
        down if the technology is followed correctly by your nail technician and the actual nail plate remains
        untouched.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, to summarize: there is no need to be afraid of gel polish - it is absolutely safe for your nails. The main
        thing is to do a manicure clearly in compliance with the technology, and for this you should choose only
        high-quality gel polish and trust your hands only to an experienced nail specialist.
